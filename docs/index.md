# Red: Production-Grade Federated Learning with Ray

Welcome to the Red Federated Learning Framework documentation. Red is a cutting-edge, production-ready federated learning system built on top of Ray for scalable distributed machine learning.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Ray-Powered Distribution**: Leverages Ray's distributed computing capabilities for efficient federated learning
- **Flexible Topologies**: Support for star, ring, mesh, and custom network topologies
- **Virtual Node Architecture**: Advanced node management with lazy initialization and resource optimization
- **Production Ready**: Built with enterprise-grade reliability and scalability in mind
- **Multiple FL Schemas**: Support for traditional, decentralized, and clustered federated learning approaches

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

Red is built around several key components:

### 🔧 Core Components

- **[Federated Base]({% post_url 2024-01-01-federated-base %})**: The foundation class for all federated learning implementations
- **[Virtual Nodes]({% post_url 2024-01-02-virtual-nodes %})**: Lazy-initialized node wrappers for efficient resource management
- **[Topology Manager]({% post_url 2024-01-03-topology-manager %})**: Handles network communication and node relationships
- **[Federated Node]({% post_url 2024-01-04-federated-node %})**: Individual participant nodes in the federation

### 🌐 Network Topologies

- **Star Topology**: Centralized communication through a server node
- **Ring Topology**: Peer-to-peer communication in a circular pattern
- **Mesh Topology**: Full connectivity between all nodes
- **Custom Topology**: User-defined adjacency matrices for specialized architectures

## 📊 Ray Integration Highlights

Red extensively uses Ray for:

- **Remote Execution**: All nodes run as Ray remote actors
- **Resource Management**: Placement groups for optimal resource allocation
- **Message Passing**: Efficient inter-node communication
- **Fault Tolerance**: Built-in resilience through Ray's supervision
- **Scalability**: Dynamic scaling across multiple machines

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Distributed Machine Learning**: Train models across multiple data sources
- **Privacy-Preserving AI**: Keep data localized while sharing model updates
- **Edge Computing**: Deploy federated learning on IoT and edge devices
- **Multi-Organization Collaboration**: Enable secure ML collaboration

## 📈 Performance Benefits

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale to hundreds of participants
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal CPU/GPU utilization through Ray
- **Network Optimization**: Minimized communication overhead
- **Fault Recovery**: Automatic handling of node failures
