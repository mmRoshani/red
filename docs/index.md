# Red: Production-Grade Federated Learning Framework

Red is a cutting-edge, production-ready federated learning system built on top of Ray for scalable distributed machine learning. It enables organizations to collaborate on machine learning models while keeping their data private and secure.

## 🚀 Overview

Red provides a comprehensive framework for federated learning that combines the power of Ray's distributed computing with advanced federated learning algorithms. Our system is designed for production environments and can scale to handle hundreds of participants.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Ray-Powered Distribution**: Efficient federated learning through Ray's distributed computing
- **Flexible Topologies**: Star, ring, mesh, and custom network configurations  
- **Virtual Node Architecture**: Advanced resource management with lazy initialization
- **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade reliability and scalability
- **Multiple FL Schemas**: Support for various federated learning approaches

## Architecture Overview

```

## Core Components

### 🏗️ Federated Base
The foundation class for all federated learning implementations, providing core functionality and lifecycle management.

### 🔄 Virtual Nodes  
Lazy-initialized node wrappers that optimize resource management and enable efficient scaling.

### 🌐 Topology Manager
Handles network communication and node relationships, supporting various network topologies.

### 📊 Federated Node
Individual participant nodes in the federation, managing local model training and updates.

## Ray Integration

Red leverages Ray's powerful distributed computing capabilities:

- **Remote Execution**: All nodes run as Ray remote actors
- **Resource Management**: Optimal resource allocation through placement groups  
- **Message Passing**: Efficient inter-node communication
- **Fault Tolerance**: Built-in resilience through Ray's supervision
- **Scalability**: Dynamic scaling across multiple machines
