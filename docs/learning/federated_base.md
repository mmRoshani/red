# FederatedBase

The Federation class serves as the foundational abstraction for constructing federated learning systems.
Its core responsibilities encompass the instantiation of participating nodes and the orchestration of the network topology.
Furthermore, this class manages the execution of both training and evaluation procedures on the models distributed across the federation,
adhering to the specified federated learning algorithm.
